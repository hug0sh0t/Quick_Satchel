# what problem does qsatchel solve? 
Many expense management systems that I have encountered in the market provide a surplus of what I need in terms of tracking my expenses.
Many of which are very time consuming when it comes to setup, and configuration of all my expenses. 
QuickSatchel is very easy to set up, and the User Interface that I created is very easy to use. 
Aside from the speed that Quick Satchel Provides, It also gives users the chance to visualize their expenses.


# How The Percentage Allocation Doughnut Engine was made

  
    for p in user_pockets: # user_pockets is the obj, holding the users pocket values
        absoluteSatchel += abs(p.price)
        if p.price >= 0:      
            positiveWeights.insert(0, (abs(p.price)/int(absoluteSatchel))*100)    
        else:
            negativeWeights.insert(0, (abs(p.price)/int(absoluteSatchel))*100)
     # Percentage Algorithm 
     dynamicPercentArray.insert(0, (abs(p.price)/int(absoluteSatchel))*100)

    for posW in positiveWeights:
        positiveWeightTotal += posW      # the postive percentage w/r to abs sum
    for negW in negativeWeights:
        negativeWeightTotal += negW      # the negative percentage w/r to abs sum
